The file contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head 

The Task is to compute strongly connected components (SCCs) using Depth First Search algorithm
