## Task

The task in this problem is to code up the greedy algorithm  (for minimizing the weighted sum ) that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the difference (weight - length).

## Data

This file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format:

[number_of_jobs]

[job_1_weight] [job_1_length]

[job_2_weight] [job_2_length]
