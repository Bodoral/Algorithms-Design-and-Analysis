## Task

The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm and then compute the number of target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] such that there are distinct numbers x,y in the input file that satisfy x+y=t.

## Data

The file contains 1 million integers, both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!)
