## Task

Implement the clustering algorithm for computing a max-spacing k-clustering.and find the maximum spacing of a 4-clustering

## Data

This file describes a distance function (equivalently, a complete graph with edge costs). It has the following format:

[number_of_nodes]

[edge 1 node 1] [edge 1 node 2] [edge 1 cost]

[edge 2 node 1] [edge 2 node 2] [edge 2 cost]
