## Task

The task is to implement  heap-based Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on the given graph, using 1 ,to compute the shortest-path distances between the first vertex and every other vertex of the graph. 

## Data

The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. Each row consists of the node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length of that edge.
